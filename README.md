<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Dan!</h1>
<h4 align="center">With 5 Years of Python, 1 Year Professionally of Java, and 16 years of Lua, I'm a Full-Stack Software and Cybersecurity Developer!</h4>
<div>I started programming at 12 and spent about 16 years making scripts in Lua. I additionally have worked at the kernel level in C and on small projects in C#, C++, Kotlin, and various SQL systems. I like to design video games in my free time. I've worked extensively with various forensic tools and in other cybersecurity areas. I'm looking to continue my career in a place that promotes learning and has room for advancement.</div>

<h3>7/29/23 Note: </h3>
<div>I started development on "Creatures of Habbitt", my commercial puzzle RPG, on February 14th, 2023 (the initial commit for that repo was on January 27th for a different project that then turned into CoH). My commit streak is legitimate and not generated by an external app. In case anyone is wondering if my streak and commit history are real, since the repo it's based on is private, I've contributed to CoH daily (sometimes multiple times) for the last 5 months and will continue to do so until development is complete. A demo will be up in a public repo when it is ready.</div>
