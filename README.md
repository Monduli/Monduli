<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Dan!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Iâ€™m a Backend Developer with some Front End experience.</h3>
<div>I've been coding for 3 years professionally in Java/Python and much longer than that (about 16 years, since I was 12) in Lua. I have some experience with C++ and like to design video games in my free time. I've worked extensively with various forensic tools and in other cybersecurity areas. I'm looking to start my career in a place that promotes learning and has room for advancement.</div>
