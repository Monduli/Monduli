## Python, Java, and AI Developer

I started coding in Python in January 2020 and it has become my main programming language. I have experience with various Python projects, including:
- Plant Encyclopedia
- Puzzle RPG video game
- Mapping API
- Weather API
- Quiz generator for employers
- Solutions for Advent of Code 2023

In June 2022, I began learning Java as my secondary language. I gained professional experience with Java and AWS during my internship at Amazon in the summer of 2022.

I have also worked on projects using C and Rust for about 3 months as part of my coursework. Additionally, I have been learning the Godot language since September of last year for game development.

Currently, I work as an AI annotator and full-stack software developer.

While I have not extensively coded in Lua, I interacted with premade Lua scripts for about 3 years when I was 12 years old, marking the beginning of my programming journey in 2007.
